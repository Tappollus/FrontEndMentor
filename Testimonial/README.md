### Screenshot

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to use the div-element and display-attribute to position the reviews. In my experience it is a cumbersome way to style a grid like this. After watching [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell) i learned there are way easier ways to do this. 

### Continued development

In the future i want to focus more on less is more. Learning about grid en flexbox in more detail so i can make things more responsive without coding this much. I also want to apply more semantic HTML to get a better ordening in my HTML files.
